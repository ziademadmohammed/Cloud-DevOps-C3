# Adopting CI / CD

### Fundamental Concepts:

- **Continus Delivery**: a Software engineered practice / approach for teams to produce and release software (code versions) in short cycles.

> **Benefit: deliver “near-production-quality” to clients as quickly as possible**

- **Continuous Integration**: the practice of merging all the developers work, in an Automated and Systematic Fashion to prepare the code for Deployment.

> **Benefit: Big short-cut to a lot of time consuming & Recuring processes so More Production is Achievable from Development-Team || More control & reduce costs**

- **Continuous Deployment**: the practice of automating everything related to deploying the Software the Result of CI (ARTIFACT)

> **Benefit: another major decrease in time consuming & Recuring processes so More Production is Achievable from Operations-Team || More control & reduce costs**

### Benefits of the DevOps CI/CD Practice

- **Help teams ship code to production faster**

- **Shortens the feedback loop between developers / engineers and customers**

- **No more risk of human errors**

- **CI/CD can help produce bug-free code**

- **No more shipping large code changes that can take time to integrate and test with the code base**

- **Greatly enhances Teams Productivity**

- **detecting source of errors becomes much simpler**, Because It is much easier for QA engineers to validate small changes iteratively in a consistent system.

- **Features can get into the hands of customers in an earlier state**

- **Developers gets extra energy and more productivity**
